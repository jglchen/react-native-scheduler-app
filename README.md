# React Native Appointment Scheduler

This is the mobile version of the [Appointment Scheduler Web App](https://scheduler-app-ten.vercel.app). Once you sign up for this app, you can set up scheduled activities in the app for you. You can list the meeting targets with their email addresses and ask the app to send confirmation emails for a meeting appointment. Users can select a single date or date ranges to list out all the scheduled activities in the selected period.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/scheduler-app/builds/b893e49f-c0ba-4681-bbb7-a6a31f3cbeb6) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/scheduler-app/builds/3315b912-f965-4e99-96a1-b394bb2dc4f7).
